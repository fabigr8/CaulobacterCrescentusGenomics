# CaulobacterCrescentusGenomics
Genomic analysis of Caulobacter Crescentus with UMAP and KMEANS++

# what we did:
**DNA is usually represented as a text sequence, leveraging 4 letters to represent the constituent parts** 
- A (Adenosine),
- C (Cytosine),
- G (Guanine)
- and T (Thymine).

In this notebook I analye the genomic sequence of the bacterium **Caulobacter Crescentus**

Its a basic EDA! But based on this work we further could analyze DNA damages https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3127433/ chromosomal replication https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0147619X11001156 and so much other fancy stuff.
